    # Examples of list compreshension:

    # 1. Squaring each number in a list:
        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        squares = [num**2 for num in numbers]
        print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

    # 2. Filtering out negative numbers from a list:
        numbers = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
        positive_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num >= 0]
        print(positive_numbers)  # Output: [0, 1, 2]

    # 3. Creating a list of tuples from two separate lists:
        names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
        ages = [25, 30, 35]
        people = [(name, age) for name, age in zip(names, ages)]
